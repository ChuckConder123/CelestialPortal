                sun: "As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries Suns are fearless self-starters, bold, energetic, and natural leaders with a pioneering spirit. They thrive on action, initiative, and new challenges, often athletic and decisive, but their impulsiveness can lead to recklessness or unfinished projects. Strengths include courage and enthusiasm; weaknesses involve impatience and a tendency to dominate.",
                moon: "Aries Moon brings intense, immediate emotions that flare up passionately and honestly, like emotional firecrackers unafraid to express feelings directly. They react quickly with big energy and forgive fast, but volatility and overreactivity can cause relational friction. Key strengths are honesty and quick responsiveness; watch for impatience in processing deeper hurts.",
                rising: "Aries Rising projects confident, assertive energy that's palpable and motivating, often seen as the initiator in social settings with a competitive flair. They inspire others to strive for the top through their dynamic presence, though perceived dominance or aggression might intimidate. Embrace your leadership while softening edges for harmony."

            Taurus: {
                sun: "Taurus Suns are steady, reliable earth signs deeply connected to the material world, valuing stability, comfort, and sensual pleasures with unwavering determination. Loyal and focused, they stand their ground patiently, but stubbornness and resistance to change can stall growth. Strengths: persistence and warmth; weaknesses: complacency and over-attachment to routines.",
                moon: "Taurus Moon seeks emotional security through consistency, routine, and physical affection, processing feelings slowly and steadily with calm composure. They're easygoing and charming, loyal to a fault, but grudges linger and pressure is needed to stir their steady tides. Nurture your patience while embracing flexibility for emotional flow.",
                rising: "Taurus Rising exudes a grounded, practical charm ruled by Venus, alluring others with social graces, poise, and an appreciation for beauty. Dependable and graceful, they draw people in effortlessly, though over-indulgence or stubborn first impressions may surface. Your stability is magnetic—balance it with openness to novelty."

Strengths: innovation and sociability; weaknesses: indecision and restlessness.",
                moon: "Gemini Moon intellectualizes emotions through talk and analysis, with mercurial moods that shift rapidly and crave mental stimulation.

                sun: "Cancer Suns are intuitive nurturers, deeply emotional and family-oriented, ambitious in building security while protecting their soft core with moodiness. Empathetic and driven, they prioritize home and comfort, but overprotectiveness can isolate. Strengths: compassion and resilience; weaknesses: emotional overwhelm and clinginess.",
                moon: "Cancer Moon amplifies psychic sensitivity and empathy, absorbing others' feelings into a rich, complex inner world that's tender and home-loving. Highly intuitive, they thrive on self-care and close bonds, but boundary issues lead to mood swings. Honor your depth by setting gentle limits to avoid absorption.",
                rising: "Cancer Rising softens impressions with kind, joyful compassion, exuding warmth and approachability that builds trust quickly.

                moon: "Leo Moon infuses emotions with magnetic warmth and vulnerability, thriving on admiration, romance, and expressive parties while guarding a tender heart. Hypnotizing and relatable, they express big feelings optimistically, but dramatic tendencies arise from unmet praise. Celebrate your inner lion with balanced self-love.",
                rising: "Leo Rising glows with powerful, fun-loving charisma, commanding rooms as theatrical life-of-the-party types who ooze enthusiasm and style.

                sun: "Virgo Suns are diligent analysts with a practical eye for detail, striving for perfection through service, health, and improvement in all pursuits.

                moon: "Virgo Moon approaches emotions logically with calm reasoning, nurturing through routines and problem-solving while appearing reserved yet composed. Useful and organized, they process feelings analytically, but emotional reserve or over-criticism stifles vulnerability. Integrate heart with mind for holistic healing.",
                rising: "Virgo Rising presents as agreeable, helpful minimalists—reliable, courteous, and detail-oriented with a substance-over-flash vibe. Valued for dependability, they charm quietly, though meticulousness can seem overly critical. Your quiet competence builds empires—loosen the reins for joyful imperfection."

                moon: "Libra Moon prioritizes emotional partnerships and fairness, flirtatious and empathetic in quests for equilibrium, where harmony stabilizes their relational core. Charming yet drama-prone, they value others' views deeply, but instability without balance breeds unease. Cultivate inner peace to mirror outward grace.",
                rising: "Libra Rising embodies harmonious grace as fashion-forward peacemakers with an eye for beauty, enchanting through fairness and sociability. Balanced and flirtatious, they attune aesthetically, though over-reliance on approval dilutes authenticity. Your elegance unites—trust your innate fairness above all."

                moon: "Scorpio Moon bottles profound emotions until explosive release, intuitive about shadows with loyal extremes and psychic undercurrents in a challenging lunar terrain. Passionate yet private, they bond deeply but struggle with trust, leading to relational intensity. Transform pain into power through vulnerable release.",
                rising: "Scorpio Rising casts sultry, magnetic allure that's enigmatic and commanding, drawing attention with quiet intensity and dark humor. Intense and sexy, they hold rooms captive, though overload or aloofness intimidates. Your enigma captivates—reveal layers wisely to forge unbreakable ties."

                sun: "Sagittarius Suns are optimistic adventurers, philosophical free spirits with lucky, expansive horizons and blunt honesty that inspires growth. Independent and upbeat, they chase meaning globally, but restlessness and tactlessness wound unintentionally. Strengths: exploration and positivity; weaknesses: over-idealism and commitment-phobia.",
                moon: "Sagittarius Moon uplifts with positive, soul-bonding freedom, emotionally fulfilled by exploration, new experiences, and meaningful connections that evade cages. Enthusiastic and open, they idealize bonds, but detachment arises from unmet wanderlust. Feed your archer's quest with grounded optimism.",
                rising: "Sagittarius Rising bursts with jovial, spontaneous cheer, honest and enthusiastic wanderers who spin positives and plan adventures, making others feel lucky. Adaptable and direct, they inspire spins on life, though bluntness lacks tact. Your fire ignites journeys—temper arrows with empathy."

                sun: "Capricorn Suns climb ambitiously with disciplined practicality, responsible high-achievers humorous in dry wit, patient and structured for long-term success. Mature and integral, they build legacies, but rigidity and workaholism block vulnerability. Strengths: determination and reliability; weaknesses: emotional guardedness.",
                moon: "Capricorn Moon reserves feelings behind self-reliant maturity from early hardships, suppressing for practicality while craving secure commitments. Resilient and structured, they handle emotions with ambition, but guardedness stems from forced growth. Honor your mountain goat's climb with tender pauses.",
                rising: "Capricorn Rising appears serious, competent executives—driven, mature, and beyond reproach, revealing warmth only to trusted few after proving diligence. Persevering and integral, they exceed expectations, though coldness seems aloof. Your steadfast peak commands respect—soften summits with shared vulnerability."

Creative yet aloof, they recharge eccentrically, but over-logic starves the heart. Blend your air's intellect with watery intuition for balanced rebellion.",

Visionary and quirky, they spark change, though rebellion for its sake disrupts. Your electric aura revolutionizes—ground genius in compassionate connection."

Creative and boundary-fluid, they heal through magic, but escapism and indecisiveness dissolve resolve. Strengths: empathy and creativity; weaknesses: overwhelm and vagueness.",

Sensitive and romantic, they attune universally, but boundary dissolution leads to lostness. Anchor your oceanic soul with compassionate anchors.",

Versatile and empathetic, they enchant softly, though impressionability blurs self. Your ethereal glow dissolves divides—set subtle sails for directed flow."
